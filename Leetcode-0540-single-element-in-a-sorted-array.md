## Problem Statement

- Given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.
- Find that one element

### Example

```
given [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
return 2

as it appears only once
```

## Solution Approaches

### O(N) - Bit Manipulation

- We know that `0^x=x` and `x^x=0` using [[Bit Manipulation]]
- So on applying xor on all elements of array, duplicates will cancel each other out.
- We are left with the element that occurs only once.

```cpp

int singleNonDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
	int x = 0;
	for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
		x^=nums[i];
	}
	return x;

```
