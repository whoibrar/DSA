> Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. ~GFG

### Markov Process 

- Process that which depends on the previous state

### When to Use Greedy Algorithm
- Greedy Choice
	- Choosing the optimal locally can lead to global optimal solution
- Optimal substructure
	- If optimal solution to total problem contains optimal solution to sub-problem
